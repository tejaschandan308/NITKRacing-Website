## Abstract

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design, that follows the model-template-view (MVT) architectural pattern.The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete (CRUD) interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.

Django provides a bridge between the data model and the database engine, and supports a large set of database systems including MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, etc. Django also supports NoSQL database through Django-nonrel fork. For now, the only NoSQL databases supported are MongoDB and google app engine.It consists of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes) and a relational database ("Model"), a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system ("View"), and a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller"). 

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.Django's configuration system allows third party code to be plugged into a regular project, provided that it follows the reusable app conventions. Django has built-in support for Ajax, RSS, Caching and various other frameworks.Django comes with a lightweight web server to facilitate end-to-end application development and testing.

The Model-View-Template (MVT) is slightly different from MVC. In fact the main difference between the two patterns is that Django itself takes care of the Controller part (Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View), leaving us with the template. The template is a HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL)
